# Stats Lecture Video Downloader 

Because all our lectures are online, I decided to write a python script that runs in the background and automatically downloads stats lecture videos from my professor's website whenever he updates it. This makes it easier as I don't have to regularly check his website myself!

Run on terminal using "python3 downloadstatslecture.py"
